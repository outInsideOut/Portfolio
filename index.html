			<p>I am a Backend software developer currently writing kotlin.<br/><br/>
			I graduated from the University of Lincoln in 2021 with a 1st Class Honours in Computer Science<br/>
			I started writing code in 2018.<br/>
			Since then it has become a strong passion of mine.<br/><br/>
			I love coding because it allows me to:<br/><span class="list"><span class="pink">-solve problems</span>
			<br/>- put my interest in maths and science to practical use
			<br/><span class="pink">- constantly learn new techniques and skills</span>

			<h3>Dreaming Spires Jinja Site</h3>
			<p>
				Continuing freelance web development work, I took a job developing a rework to the DreamingSpires website. <br>
				Dreaming Spires is an Oxford-based start-up which finds developers for projects which need programming. <br>
				Working with Dreaming Spires enhanced my knowledge of working as part of a team on a collaborative github repo. <br>
				Also it taught me some Jinja-based dynamic propogation skills which were new to me and I think will be very useful.

			<h3>I Finally Switched to Linux!</h3>
			<p>
				Starting the 3rd year of my CS degree, I decided there was an area that I really needed to, and wanted to educate myself on... Linux! <br>
				I have always been intrigued by open-source operating-systems from an ethical standing, and know that linux is widely used for research and development due to the control it gives the user.
				I'm excited to become a terminal-wiz! <br>
				<br><i>EDIT</i>:<br>I am loving Linux as a work OS and have settled on Ubuntu as my distro for now. V happy :).

			<h3>Fractions - A C++ .lib (static library)</h3>
			<p>Whilst working on a C++ solution to derive the value of pi from a conservation of momentum physics simulation,<br>
				floating point errors were proving to be a considerable problem. However, compute time wasn't a problem,<br>
				Therefore I have created a Fraction C++ class which will allow for standard algebra and arithmetic with<br>
				non-algebraic numbers.

			<h3>Raspberry Pi - Minecraft Server</h3>
			<p>Finding a very similar method to the one I had devised already exists (produced by James Chambers),<br>
				I made a fork from his github repo so that I could make some changes to the shell script automation, adding extra features<br>
				I have submitted a pull request as I beleive merging the repos would be an improvement to the original.

			<h3>Microsoft Technology Associate<br/>Introduction to Programming using Javascript, Java and Python</h3>
			<p>I took three more MTA exams after I had finished my 2nd academic year. <br/>
			I chose this as an opportunity to widen my programming language base.	
			I opted into Python and Javascript programming as I had some experience in those languages, </br>
			and Java as it Is something that I know can be a very useful skill!

			<p>I have always really enjoyed sudoku puzzles.<br/> 
				They engage my logically and pass the time well<br/>
			After studying object orientated programming I could see a clear abstraction of the puzzle and wanted to have a crack at writing a program to solve them.<br/>
			Having never used python before and hearing that it is a good language to know I decided to try use this project as an opportunity to learn</p>
